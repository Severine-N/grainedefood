## Goal of the project
___

Graine de Food was created for French content creator [Graine de Magie](https://www.instagram.com/grainedemagie/?hl=fr "Link to Graine de Magie Instagram Page"). She wanted an **e-commerce platform** where she could sell local food in subscription boxes to her followers. She gave us free rein to build the website from scratch.

## My role as a Scrum Master
___

Although we all worked on both frontend and backend development, each member had an additional area of expertise that helped with our organization and decision process. 

I was Scrum Master, in charge of hosting daily stand-up meetings, maintaining the team's kanban and schedule, as well as writing the project logbook. 

This role suited me well, thanks to my 10-year experience as a sales administrator and production coordinator.
